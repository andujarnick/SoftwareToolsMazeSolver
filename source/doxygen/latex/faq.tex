\hypertarget{faq_faq_index}{}\doxysection{How to get information on the index page in H\+T\+M\+L?}\label{faq_faq_index}
You should use the \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdmainpage}{\textbackslash{}mainpage}} command inside a comment block like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}/*! \mainpage My Personal Index Page
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is the introduction.

\hypertarget{faq_fac_al}{}\doxysection{Help, some/all of the members of my class / file / namespace are not documented?}\label{faq_fac_al}
Check the following\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Is your class / file / namespace documented? If not, it will not be extracted from the sources unless E\+X\+T\+R\+A\+C\+T\+\_\+\+A\+LL is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} in the configuration file. 
\item Are the members private? If so, you must set E\+X\+T\+R\+A\+C\+T\+\_\+\+P\+R\+I\+V\+A\+TE to {\ttfamily Y\+ES} to make them appear in the documentation. 
\item Is there a function macro in your class that does not end with a semicolon (e.\+g. M\+Y\+\_\+\+M\+A\+C\+R\+O())? If so then you have to instruct doxygen\textquotesingle{}s preprocessor to remove it.

This typically boils down to the following settings in the configuration file\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}ENABLE_PREPROCESSING   = YES
MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES
EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES
PREDEFINED             = MY_MACRO()=\end{DoxyVerb}


Please read the \mbox{\hyperlink{preprocessing}{preprocessing}} section of the manual for more information. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{faq_faq_extract_all}{}\doxysection{When I set E\+X\+T\+R\+A\+C\+T\+\_\+\+A\+L\+L to N\+O none of my functions are shown in the documentation.}\label{faq_faq_extract_all}
In order for global functions, variables, enums, typedefs, and defines to be documented you should document the file in which these commands are located using a comment block containing a \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdfile}{\textbackslash{}file}} (or \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdfile}{@file}}) command.

Alternatively, you can put all members in a group (or module) using the \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdingroup}{\textbackslash{}ingroup}} command and then document the group using a comment block containing the \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmddefgroup}{\textbackslash{}defgroup}} command.

For member functions or functions that are part of a namespace you should document either the class or namespace.\hypertarget{faq_faq_ext_mapping}{}\doxysection{My file with a custom extension is not parsed (properly) (anymore).}\label{faq_faq_ext_mapping}
Doxygen only parses files that are specified as input (via the I\+N\+P\+UT tag) and that match a specified extension (mentioned in F\+I\+L\+E\+\_\+\+P\+A\+T\+T\+E\+R\+NS) The list of files is then reduced by excluding files listed as E\+X\+C\+L\+U\+DE or files that match the patterns set by E\+X\+C\+L\+U\+D\+E\+\_\+\+P\+A\+T\+T\+E\+R\+NS.

In the past doxygen parsed all files with an unknown extension as C files which could lead to undesired results. Since version 1.\+8.\+8, doxygen requires that you specify a mapping that tells for a certain file extension, which parser to use. This mapping is specified using the E\+X\+T\+E\+N\+S\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+M\+A\+P\+P\+I\+NG tag. If no mapping is specified the file\textquotesingle{}s contents will be ignored.\hypertarget{faq_faq_code}{}\doxysection{How can I make doxygen ignore some code fragment?}\label{faq_faq_code}
The new and easiest way is to add one comment block with a \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdcond}{\textbackslash{}cond}} command at the start and one comment block with a \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdendcond}{\textbackslash{}endcond}} command at the end of the piece of code that should be ignored. This should be within the same file of course.

But you can also use doxygen\textquotesingle{}s preprocessor for this\+: If you put \begin{DoxyVerb}#ifndef DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS

 /* code that must be skipped by doxygen */

#endif /* DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS */
\end{DoxyVerb}
 around the blocks that should be hidden and put\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  PREDEFINED = DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS
\end{DoxyVerb}
 in the configuration file then all blocks should be skipped by doxygen as long as E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+P\+R\+O\+C\+E\+S\+S\+I\+NG is set to {\ttfamily Y\+ES}.\hypertarget{faq_faq_code_inc}{}\doxysection{How can I change what is after the \#include in the class documentation?}\label{faq_faq_code_inc}
In most cases you can use S\+T\+R\+I\+P\+\_\+\+F\+R\+O\+M\+\_\+\+I\+N\+C\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH to strip a user defined part of a path.

You can also document your class as follows

\begin{DoxyVerb}/*! \class MyClassName include.h path/include.h
 *
 *  Docs for MyClassName
 */
\end{DoxyVerb}


To make doxygen put ~\newline
~\newline
 {\ttfamily  \#include $<$path/include.\+h$>$ }

in the documentation of the class My\+Class\+Name regardless of the name of the actual header file in which the definition of My\+Class\+Name is contained.

If you want doxygen to show that the include file should be included using quotes instead of angle brackets you should type\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}/*! \class MyClassName myhdr.h "path/myhdr.h"
 *
 *  Docs for MyClassName
 */
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{faq_faq_chm}{}\doxysection{How can I use tag files in combination with compressed H\+T\+M\+L?}\label{faq_faq_chm}
If you want to refer from one compressed H\+T\+ML file {\ttfamily a.\+chm} to another compressed H\+T\+ML file called {\ttfamily b.\+chm}, the link in {\ttfamily a.\+chm} must have the following format\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<a href="mk:@MSITStore:b.chm::/file.html">
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Unfortunately this only works if both compressed H\+T\+ML files are in the same directory.

As a result you must rename the generated {\ttfamily index.\+chm} files for all projects into something unique and put all {\ttfamily .chm} files in one directory.

Suppose you have a project {\itshape a} referring to a project {\itshape b} using tag file {\ttfamily b.\+tag}, then you could rename the {\ttfamily index.\+chm} for project {\itshape a} into {\ttfamily a.\+chm} and the {\ttfamily index.\+chm} for project {\itshape b} into {\ttfamily b.\+chm}. In the configuration file for project {\itshape a} you write\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}TAGFILES = b.tag=mk:@MSITStore:b.chm::
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{faq_faq_html}{}\doxysection{I don\textquotesingle{}t like the quick index that is put above each H\+T\+M\+L page, what do I do?}\label{faq_faq_html}
You can disable the index by setting D\+I\+S\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+I\+N\+D\+EX to {\ttfamily Y\+ES}. Then you can put in your own header file by writing your own header and feed that to H\+T\+M\+L\+\_\+\+H\+E\+A\+D\+ER.\hypertarget{faq_faq_html_header}{}\doxysection{The overall H\+T\+M\+L output looks different, while I only wanted to use my own html header file}\label{faq_faq_html_header}
You probably forgot to include the stylesheet {\ttfamily doxygen.\+css} that doxygen generates. You can include this by putting \begin{DoxyVerb}<LINK HREF="doxygen.css" REL="stylesheet" TYPE="text/css">
\end{DoxyVerb}
 in the H\+E\+AD section of the H\+T\+ML page.\hypertarget{faq_faq_use_qt}{}\doxysection{Why does doxygen use Qt?}\label{faq_faq_use_qt}
In the past (prior to version 1.\+9.\+2) doxygen used a part of Qt 2.\+x for various utility classes. These have been replaced by S\+TL container classes in the meantime.

The G\+UI front-\/end called Doxywizard is based on a modern version of Qt. Doxygen itself can also be used without the G\+UI.\hypertarget{faq_faq_excl_dir}{}\doxysection{How can I exclude all test directories from my directory tree?}\label{faq_faq_excl_dir}
Simply put an exclude pattern like this in the configuration file\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = */test/*
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{faq_faq_class}{}\doxysection{Doxygen automatically generates a link to the class My\+Class somewhere in the running text.  How do I prevent that at a certain place?}\label{faq_faq_class}
Put a \% in front of the class name. Like this\+: \%My\+Class. Doxygen will then remove the \% and keep the word unlinked.\hypertarget{faq_faq_pgm_X}{}\doxysection{My favorite programming language is X. Can I still use doxygen?}\label{faq_faq_pgm_X}
No, not as such; doxygen needs to understand the structure of what it reads. If you don\textquotesingle{}t mind spending some time on it, there are several options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the grammar of X is close to C or C++, then it is probably not too hard to tweak {\ttfamily src/scanner.\+l} a bit so the language is supported. This is done for all other languages directly supported by doxygen (i.\+e. Java, I\+DL, C\#, P\+HP).
\item If the grammar of X is somewhat different than you can write an input filter that translates X into something similar enough to C/\+C++ for doxygen to understand (this approach is taken for VB, Object Pascal, and Java\+Script, see \href{https://www.doxygen.org/download.html\#helpers}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+doxygen.\+org/download.\+html\#helpers}}).
\item If the grammar is completely different one could write a parser for X and write a backend that produces a similar syntax tree as is done by {\ttfamily src/scanner.\+l} (and also by {\ttfamily src/tagreader.\+cpp} while reading tag files).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{faq_faq_lex}{}\doxysection{Help! I get the cryptic message \char`\"{}input buffer overflow, can\textquotesingle{}t enlarge buffer because scanner uses R\+E\+J\+E\+C\+T\char`\"{}}\label{faq_faq_lex}
This error happens when doxygen\textquotesingle{}s lexical scanner has a rule that matches more than 256K of input characters in one go. I\textquotesingle{}ve seen this happening on a very large generated file ($>$256K lines), where the built-\/in preprocessor converted it into an empty file (with $>$256K of newlines). Another case where this might happen is if you have lines in your code with more than 256K characters.

If you have run into such a case and want me to fix it, you should send me a code fragment that triggers the message. To work around the problem, put some line-\/breaks into your file, split it up into smaller parts, or exclude it from the input using E\+X\+C\+L\+U\+DE.

Another way to work around this problem is to use the cmake command with the option\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/Denlarge\_lex\_buffers=<size>}
\end{DoxyCode}


where {\ttfamily $<$size$>$} is the new size of the input ({\ttfamily Y\+Y\+\_\+\+B\+U\+F\+\_\+\+S\+I\+ZE}) and read ({\ttfamily Y\+Y\+\_\+\+R\+E\+A\+D\+\_\+\+B\+U\+F\+\_\+\+S\+I\+ZE}) buffer. In case this option is not given the default value of 262144 (i.\+e. 256K) will be used.\hypertarget{faq_faq_latex}{}\doxysection{When running make in the latex directory I get \char`\"{}\+Te\+X capacity exceeded\char`\"{}. Now what?}\label{faq_faq_latex}
You can edit the texmf.\+cfg file to increase the default values of the various buffers and then run \char`\"{}texconfig init\char`\"{}.\hypertarget{faq_faq_stl}{}\doxysection{Why are dependencies via S\+T\+L classes not shown in the dot graphs?}\label{faq_faq_stl}
Doxygen is unaware of the S\+TL classes, unless the option B\+U\+I\+L\+T\+I\+N\+\_\+\+S\+T\+L\+\_\+\+S\+U\+P\+P\+O\+RT is turned on.\hypertarget{faq_faq_search}{}\doxysection{I have problems getting the search engine to work with P\+H\+P5 and/or windows}\label{faq_faq_search}
Please read \href{searching.html}{\texttt{ this}} for hints on where to look.\hypertarget{faq_faq_cmdline}{}\doxysection{Can I configure doxygen from the command line?}\label{faq_faq_cmdline}
Not via command line options, but doxygen can read from {\ttfamily stdin}, so you can pipe things through it. Here\textquotesingle{}s an example how to override an option in a configuration file from the command line (assuming a U\+N\+IX like environment)\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}( cat Doxyfile ; echo "PROJECT_NUMBER=1.0" ) | doxygen -
\end{DoxyVerb}


For Windows command line the following would do the same\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}( type Doxyfile & echo PROJECT_NUMBER=1.0 ) | doxygen.exe -
\end{DoxyVerb}


For Windows Powershell (checked with version 5.\+1) the following would do the same\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}&{ type Doxyfile ; echo "PROJECT_NUMBER=1.0" } | doxygen -
\end{DoxyVerb}


If multiple options with the same name are specified then doxygen will use the last one. To append to an existing option you can use the += operator.\hypertarget{faq_faq_name}{}\doxysection{How did doxygen get its name?}\label{faq_faq_name}
Doxygen got its name from playing with the words documentation and generator.

\begin{DoxyVerb}documentation -> docs -> dox
generator -> gen
\end{DoxyVerb}


At the time I was looking into {\ttfamily lex} and {\ttfamily yacc}, where a lot of things start with \char`\"{}yy\char`\"{}, so the \char`\"{}y\char`\"{} slipped in and made things pronounceable (the proper pronouncement is Docs-\/ee-\/gen, so with a long \char`\"{}e\char`\"{}).\hypertarget{faq_faq_why}{}\doxysection{What was the reason to develop doxygen?}\label{faq_faq_why}
I once wrote a G\+UI widget based on the Qt library (it is still available at \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/qdbttabular/}{\texttt{ https\+://sourceforge.\+net/projects/qdbttabular/}} but hasn\textquotesingle{}t been updated since 2002). Qt had nicely generated documentation (using an internal tool which \href{https://rant.gulbrandsen.priv.no/udoc/history}{\texttt{ they didn\textquotesingle{}t want to release}}) and I wrote similar docs by hand. This was a nightmare to maintain, so I wanted a similar tool. I looked at Doc++ but that just wasn\textquotesingle{}t good enough (it didn\textquotesingle{}t support signals and slots and did not have the Qt look and feel I had grown to like), so I started to write my own tool...\hypertarget{faq_faq_bin}{}\doxysection{How to prevent interleaved output}\label{faq_faq_bin}
When redirecting all the console output of doxygen, i.\+e. messages and warnings, this can be interleaved or in a non-\/expected order. The, technical, reason for this is that the {\ttfamily stdout} can be buffered. It is possible to overcome this by means of the {\ttfamily -\/b} of doxygen, like e.\+g {\ttfamily doxygen -\/b $>$ out.\+txt 2$>$\&1}. Note this might cost a little more time though.
