Doxygen provides a number of ways to create lists of items.

{\bfseries{Using dashes}}

By putting a number of column-\/aligned minus (-\/) signs at the start of a line, a bullet list will automatically be generated. Instead of the minus sign also plus (+) or asterisk ($\ast$) can be used.

Numbered lists can also be generated by using a minus followed by a hash or by using a number followed by a dot.

Nesting of lists is allowed and is based on indentation of the items.

Here is an example\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}  /*! 
   *  A list of events:
   *    - mouse events
   *         -# mouse move event
   *         -# mouse click event\n
   *            More info about the click event.
   *         -# mouse double click event
   *    - keyboard events
   *         1. key down event
   *         2. key up event
   *
   *  More text here.
   */
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The result will be\+:

A list of events\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item mouse events
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item mouse move event
\item mouse click event~\newline
 More info about the click event.
\item mouse double click event
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item keyboard events
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item key down event
\item key up event
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you use tabs for indentation within lists, please make sure that T\+A\+B\+\_\+\+S\+I\+ZE in the configuration file is set to the correct tab size.

You can end a list by starting a new paragraph or by putting a dot (.) on an empty line at the same indentation level as the list you would like to end.

Here is an example that speaks for itself\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}/**
 * Text before the list
 * - list item 1
 *   - sub item 1
 *     - sub sub item 1
 *     - sub sub item 2
 *     . 
 *     The dot above ends the sub sub item list.
 *
 *     More text for the first sub item
 *   .
 *   The dot above ends the first sub item.
 *
 *   More text for the first list item
 *   - sub item 2
 *   - sub item 3
 * - list item 2
 * .
 * More text in the same paragraph.
 *
 * More text in a new paragraph.
 */
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries{Using H\+T\+ML commands}}

If you like you can also use H\+T\+ML commands inside the documentation blocks.

Here is the above example with H\+T\+ML commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  /*! 
   *  A list of events:
   *  <ul>
   *  <li> mouse events
   *     <ol>
   *     <li>mouse move event
   *     <li>mouse click event<br>
   *         More info about the click event.
   *     <li>mouse double click event
   *     </ol>
   *  <li> keyboard events
   *     <ol>     
   *     <li>key down event
   *     <li>key up event
   *     </ol>
   *  </ul>
   *  More text here.
   */
\end{DoxyVerb}


\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
In this case the indentation is not important.

{\bfseries{Using \textbackslash{}arg or \textbackslash{}li}}

For compatibility with the Qt Software\textquotesingle{}s internal documentation tool qdoc and with K\+Doc, doxygen has two commands that can be used to create simple unnested lists.

See \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdarg}{\textbackslash{}arg}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{commands_cmdli}{\textbackslash{}li}} for more info.
